# Build-a-Mon

## A Custom *Pokémon* Editor

This project is based on the popular Nintendo video game franchise, *Pokémon*, which involves capturing and fighting
with creatures. Growing up, I **loved** *Pokémon* games, often designing and drawing my own ideas for *Pokémon* on 
pieces of scrap paper. However, I would have trouble keeping track of all my *Pokémon* and often lost my 
designs since there was no convenient way to organize them. 

This application digitalizes the aforementioned process, allowing avid *Pokémon* fans to implement their ideas for new
*Pokémon* with just the click of a few buttons. Users can easily customize all attributes associated with a *Pokémon*,
including their name and stats. This application thus allows *Pokémon* lovers to experience these games without
having to own a video game console.
